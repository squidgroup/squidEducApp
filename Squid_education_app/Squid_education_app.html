<h3>SQuID
goal<img id="logo" src="images/squid_logo.png" align="left" alt="SQuID" width=120px heigth=120px></h3>
<p><b>SQuID</b> stands for <b>S</b>tatistical <b>Qu</b>antification of <b>I</b>ndividual <b>D</b>ifferences and is the 
                                product of the SQuID working group. The package aims to help scholars who, 
                                like us, are interested in understanding patterns of phenotypic variance. 
                                Individual differences are the raw material for natural selection to act 
                                on and hence the basis of evolutionary adaptation. Understanding the sources 
                                of phenotypic variance is thus a most essential feature of biological investigation 
                                and mixed effects models offer a great, albeit challenging tool. 
                                Disseminating the properties, potentials and interpretational challenges 
                                in the research community is thus a foremost goal of SQuID.</p>
<p>
The squid package has two main objectives: First, it provides an
educational tool useful for students, teachers and researchers who want
to learn to use mixed-effects models. Users can experience how the
mixed-effects model framework can be used to understand distinct
biological phenomena by interactively exploring simulated multilevel
data. Second, squid offers research opportunities to those who are
already familiar with mixed-effects models, as squid enables the
generation of datasets that users may download and use for a range of
simulation-based statistical analyses such as power and sensitivity
analysis of multilevel and multivariate data.

<h3>Guidance for Users</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-4">
<h5>For Beginners</h5>
<p>The SQuID modules are designed for users who have some but not a 
                                lot of statistical background, particularly with linear mixed models. 
                                We strongly recommend that if you are in this category, you begin with 
                                the module  &ldquo;Basic Lessons&rdquo;. That should be followed by the module 
                                &ldquo;Non-stochastic environments&rdquo;. You will need to be very comfortable with 
                                the ideas here before moving on. Which module you choose next depends 
                                on your interests but Step 1 in module &ldquo;Multidimensional Plasticity&rdquo; 
                                introduces multiple regression. The module &ldquo;Random regressions&rdquo; 
                                may also be good to do after module &ldquo;Non-stochastic environments&rdquo;.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
<h5>For Teachers</h5>
<p>The SQuID modules can be very useful for teaching statistical concepts, 
                                especially ones related to linear mixed models. Which module to use 
                                depends on your students and what you want them to learn. 
                                Brief descriptors of each module are available on this page 
                                (instructions to see them). We also recommend that you skim some of 
                                the modules or visit the full equation step-by-step page to better 
                                understand how SQuID works.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
<h5>For Experts</h5>
<p>SQuID was designed to provide a user-friendly and web-based program 
                                to simulate data for testing a variety of ideas about sampling and 
                                bias in hierarchical mixed modeling. For those very familiar with 
                                these approaches and curious about SQuID, we recommend initially 
                                using the module &ldquo;Full model&rdquo; and the option &ldquo;Step-by-step&rdquo;. 
                                Once you understand how SQuID works, the &ldquo;Express model&rdquo; version 
                                will work best. Finally, we have SQuID available as an R function 
                                &ldquo;squidR()&rdquo; for those interested in doing efficient simulations.</p>

<h3>Brief description of modules</h3>
<p><b>SQuID</b> is made to help researchers to become familiar with multilevel variation, and to 
                                build up sampling designs for their study. SQuID is built up as a series of modules that guide 
                                the user into situations of increasing complexity to explore the dynamics between the way 
                                records are collected and estimates of parameters of specific interest; The last module 
                                is the <b><i>full model simulation package</i></b> that allows the user to generate data sets that can then be 
                                used to run analyses in the statistical package of their choice for specific research questions.</p>
<p>
<b>SQuID</b> is based on a mathematical model that creates a group of
individuals (i.e. study population) repeatedly expressing phenotypes,
for one or different traits, in uniform time. Phenotypic values of
traits are generated following the general principle of the phenotypic
equation
(<a href='http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.12013/abstract' target='_blank'>Dingemanse
&amp; Dochtermann 2013, Journal of Animal Ecology</a>): phenotypic
variance (<span class="math inline">\(V_P\)</span>) is assumed to be the
sum of a series of components (see the full model). The user has thus
the flexibility to add different variance components that will form the
phenotype of the individual at each time step, and to set up the
relative importance of each component. SQuiD then allows the user to
collect a subsample of phenotypes for each simulated individual
(i.e. operational data set), according to a specific sampling design.
For most of the modules, the operational data set generated is
automatically fed into a statistical model in R and the main results of
the analysis shown in an output. For the full model the user has the
opportunity to download the operational data set for further analyses.

<h2>Module 1: Basic lessons about variance</h2>

class="section level3">
<h3>Step 1. Mean and variance when the trait is expressed once and does
not change</h3>
<p>
<b>Sub-goal:</b> Illustrating the concept of variance and mean, for
traits with no within-individual variance but which is measured with
error.
</p>
<p>
<b>Introduction:</b> This is the simplest possible situation. A trait as
measured for a group of individuals from a population is characterised
by a mean (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>) and a variance
(<span class="math inline">\(V_P\)</span>).
</p>
<p>
In every case that we measure something, we know that we are making an
error in the measurement. This error is assumed to be non-directional
and hopefully represents only a small portion of the total variance
<span class="math inline">\(V_P\)</span>. Below play with the error
term. Generally measurement error variance should not be high, ideally
lower than 5% of the total variance, but of course some traits can be
associated with much higher measurement error.
</p>
<p>
An explanation of notation: There are several kinds of unaccounted
variance in a statistical model. This are called, variously, “error
variance” or “residual variance”.<br />
Measurement error is one source of this variance, but as you will see
below, not all unaccounted variance is the result of error. To
distinguish these with notation, we will use <span
class="math inline">\(V_m\)</span> for measurement error and <span
class="math inline">\(V_R\)</span> for the more general residual
variance. In this particular step, <span
class="math inline">\(V_R=V_m\)</span>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise:</b> In this situation we assume that we only have one value
of the trait for each individual. You first have to decide how many
individuals to measure.
</p>
<div style="clear:both; text-align:center">
<img id="logo" src="images/underConstruction_pic.png" align="center" alt="Modules" width=120px height=120px>
</div>
<p>
<b>Point:</b> The variance of measures <span
class="math inline">\((V&#39;_P)\)</span> is often higher than the
variance of true individual variance <span
class="math inline">\((V_I)\)</span> if there is measurement error (and
there will always be some). The estimate of total variance includes both
individual differences <span class="math inline">\((V_I)\)</span> (not
measured directly) and measurement error <span
class="math inline">\((V_m)\)</span>. Note also that the estimated <span
class="math inline">\(V&#39;_P\)</span> (total variance of sampled
values) typically differs slightly from 1. This is because we have
sampled from a population where the true total phenotypic variance that
includes individual (biological) variance and measurement error
variance, while equal to 1, may not be 1 in your sample. The difference
thus arises from sampling variance.
</p>
<p>
<b>Solutions:</b> First work to reduce the measurement error; to do so,
you need to know the magnitude of measurement error. This requires
measuring individuals more than once. This is explained in step 2 of
this module.
</p>
<b>Statistical model:</b>
<p>
Throughout these modules we will provide you with the statistical model
that we’ve explored. These come in two forms. The first is an equation
that describes each data point (particular measurements on individual
phenotypes). Since we are using phenotypic measures as the focus here,
we call this the “phenotypic equation”. You have just explored the
following phenotypic equation:
</p>
<p>$$y_{hi}=I_i+e_{hi}$$</p>
<p>
where <span class="math inline">\(y_{hi}\)</span> is the measured
phenotypic value of the <span class="math inline">\(h^{th}\)</span>
measurement (in this case <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> = 1) on
the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> individual, <span
class="math inline">\(I_i\)</span> is the true deviation of the
individual’s trait from the population mean (which is assumed to be 0
for now), and <span class="math inline">\(e_{hi}\)</span> is the
residual deviation of that measurement from the true value, caused in
this scenario by measurement error.
</p>
<p>
The second type of equation is a partitioning of variance where the
terms are defined as above. These have direct connection to the values
in the phenotypic equation, with the exception that in this scenario the
variance in <span class="math inline">\(e_{hi}\)</span>, often called
residual variance, is measurement variance <span
class="math inline">\((V_m)\)</span>
</p>
<p><p>$$V_p=V_I+V_m$$</p></p>
</div>
<div id="section-step-2-repeatability-and-measurement-error"
class="section level3">
<h3>Step 2: Repeatability and measurement error</h3>
<p>
<b>Sub-goal:</b> Learning how to estimate measurement error variance
<span class="math inline">\((V_m)\)</span> in traits varying solely
among individuals.
</p>
<p>
<b>Introduction:</b> In the previous step, you estimated the mean and
the total variance of a sample of individuals measured once. From this
you learned that some of the observed variation in measures might be due
to measurement error, which occurs when the measured value deviates (for
whatever reason) from the biological value. Here we detail the sampling
design that you might use to directly estimate the magnitude of
measurement error; we do this for a trait where the true value of the
trait is constant for an individual (cf. a ‘fixed’ rather than ‘labile’
trait, e.g. structural size in adulthood). Measurement error can be
estimated by measuring the same set of individuals multiple times
(preferably in a blind and randomized order). Since their trait values
are fixed, any deviation in measured values across measurements of the
same individuals should be due to measurement error.
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise:</b> To simulate this new situation, we advise using the
same parameters as in the previous step, in terms of the number of
individuals and measurement error (<span
class="math inline">\(V_m\)</span>; expressed as a proportion of the
total phenotypic variance, <span class="math inline">\(V_P\)</span>) so
that you can compare your output with the previous step:
</p>
<div style="clear:both; text-align:center">
<img id="logo" src="images/underConstruction_pic.png" align="center" alt="Modules" width=120px height=120px>
</div>
<p>
You also need to enter how often each individual is measured. We call
this variable ‘Number of trait expressions’. For simplicity, we are
assuming that each individual is measured the same number of times.
Because we are interested in setting up a scenario where individuals are
assayed repeatedly, you should set a number equal or greater than two.
Play around with how often you measure each individual, because the
number of repeated measurements per individual affects how well your
estimated values approximate the true values.
</p>
<p>
As before, we present the output in the form of a collection of figures
and tables that shows you your estimated values (derived from a
univariate mixed-effects model) as well as the true values. Compare how
the estimated values deviate from the true values; play for example with
the ‘number of trait expressions’ to see how the number of repeated
measurements per individual affects your estimates and how much they
deviate from the true values.
</p>
<p>
The three density plots show the distribution of estimated total
phenotypic variance <span class="math inline">\((V&#39;_P)\)</span>, the
estimated variance among individuals <span
class="math inline">\((V&#39;_I)\)</span>, and the estimated variance
within individuals <span class="math inline">\((V&#39;_m)\)</span>. It
demonstrates graphically that <span
class="math inline">\(V&#39;_P=V&#39;_I+V&#39;_m\)</span>.
</p>
<p>
A mixed statistical model estimates these parameters:
</p>
<p>
<b>Point: </b> If you have inputted the same parameter values as for
step 1, you see that we are now (more) properly estimating the
individual variance. This is because we have directly estimated the
within-individual variance due to measurement error by measuring each
individual (at least) twice.
</p>
<p>
Measurement error can obscure true biological variance. We typically
express the amount of biological variance we can measure as a proportion
of the total observed variance; this standardized metric is called
"repeatability":
</p>
<p>
$$Repeatability=\frac{V^\prime_I}{V^\prime_I+V^\prime_m}$$
<script>if (window.MathJax) MathJax.Hub.Queue(["Typeset", MathJax.Hub]);</script>
</p>
<p>
Repeatability tells you how well your current measurement predicts a
future measurement of the same individual. Logically, the repeatability
is 1 if there is no measurement error (try it out!). The effect of
measurement error can be nicely illustrated in a graph where we plot the
first vs. second measurement.
</p>
<p>
The scatter plot shows how correlated the first and second measurements
are. In the absence of measurement error (i.e., <span
class="math inline">\(V_m=0\)</span>), all points align on a single line
(<span class="math inline">\(y=x\)</span>). Play around with the
settings of <span class="math inline">\(V_m\)</span>; the higher the
value, the more widely the data points get dispersed around <span
class="math inline">\(y=x\)</span>, i.e. the higher the measurement
error the lower our ability to predict an individual’s phenotype based
on a previous measurement. Repeatability thus provides an assessment of
how well one has measured a particular phenotype. Repeatability can be
used for several other purposes too, so the way it is calculated may
vary some. We will develop some of these nuances later on.

<div id="section-step-3-within--and-among-individual-variance"
class="section level3">
<h3>Step 3: Within- and among-individual variance</h3>
<p>
<b>Sub-goal:</b> to illustrate hierarchical structure of variance when
individuals express traits multiple times (a trait varies
within-individuals).
</p>
<p>
<b>Introduction:</b> Individuals express different values of a trait at
different times due to the influence of the environment. Collecting two
or more measures for each individual provides several types of
information. We have already seen that it can allow estimation of
measurement error. If the measurements are spread over time, then you
can also estimate how much variance is due to the environment and how
the phenotype responds to the environment. Finally, repeated
measurements can measure whether differences among individuals are
solely due to differences in the environment at the time of measurement
versus to some other source, such as differences among individuals that
were generated before the period of measurement.
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise:</b> As in the two previous steps we will generate a new
group of individuals but we will also add a new form of variance.
Previously, you generated a population of individuals that varied in
their true value <span class="math inline">\((V_I)\)</span> and also due
to observer measurement error <span
class="math inline">\((V_m)\)</span>. We assumed that individuals had
the same trait value throughout the duration of our study. But, what if
trait values changed over time, perhaps in response to some
environmental gradient? To start exploring this idea, let’s assume that
all individuals would respond to this gradient in the same way, but they
might experience different values of the environment.<br />
This means that in addition to <span class="math inline">\(V_I\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(V_m\)</span> there is variation caused
by the population mean response to an environmental effect on the
phenotype of an individual. In this step, the environmental effect is
considered as individual-specific but unknown to the observer. An
(individual-) specific environmental effect means that each individual
of the population will experience different environmental conditions
than do other individuals. For instance, the intensity of intra- and
inter-specific competition within a population might be experienced
differently between individuals. An unknown environmental effect
represents environmental values that are not measured thus cannot be
included in the statistical analysis. Earlier we noted that <span
class="math inline">\(V_R\)</span> is called “residual variance”. Now,
unknown, environmentally-caused variance will be combined with <span
class="math inline">\(V_m\)</span> to make <span
class="math inline">\(V_R\)</span>, and is the primary reason for
calling it “residual” variance.<br />
In reality, there may be many environmental effects, both known and
unknown. We will use the term <span class="math inline">\(V_E\)</span>
to refer to all phenotypic variance caused by the environment. Known
environmental variance will be indicated by <span
class="math inline">\(V_{\beta x}\)</span>.
</p>
<p>
In this simulation, let’s assume there is only one environmental effect.
We will specify it to generate phenotypes, so let’s use the term <span
class="math inline">\(V_{\beta x}\)</span>. You can thus try several
combinations of <span class="math inline">\(V_m\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(V_I\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(V_{\beta x}\)</span> (with the constraint that
they add up to 1) to uncover how the input values affect the estimates
of repeatability and each variance component. Just remember that for now
<span class="math inline">\(V_{\beta x}\)</span> is one environmental
effect but it will be measured as part of the residual.
</p>
<div style="clear:both; text-align:center">
<img id="logo" src="images/underConstruction_pic.png" align="center" alt="Modules" width=120px height=120px>
</div>
<p>
A mixed statistical model estimates these parameters:
</p>
<p>
Once again you can calculate repeatability as
</p>
<p>$$Repeatability=\frac{V^\prime_I}{V^\prime_I+V^\prime_R}$$</p>
<p>
<b>Point:</b> We can now estimate a particular variance component of
<span class="math inline">\(V_{P}\)</span> that represents
among-individual differences that are consistent through time. This
variance is also, in some circumstances, the index for individual
“personality” differences. The residual variance combines both
measurement error and the variance caused by the unmeasured (unknown)
specific environment to each individual. <span
class="math inline">\(V_{E}\)</span> in general reflects plasticity to
unknown environments, with <span class="math inline">\(V_{\beta
x}\)</span> indicating variance due to a specified environmental
variable <span class="math inline">\((x)\)</span>, which so far has not
been measured.
</p>
<p>
You can now test whether the number of individuals sampled and the
number of repeated measures per individual can affect your estimation.
</p>
<p>
Repeatability now does not represent the same thing as previously
because the denominator of the ratio includes both measurement error and
variance due to plasticity. This new repeatability is not simply a
measure of your skill at measuring phenotypes. Instead, it now is an
estimate of a biological phenomenon: consistent individual differences
(i.e. personality in the case of behaviour). This estimate is
conservative because measurement error reduces the estimate to be less
than the true biological repeatability. Measurement errors in this
scenario are not separable from the plastic response of individuals to
an unmeasured environment. To calculate measurement error alone, you
would have to collect more than one measure on the same trait for each
individual in the same environment (e.g. two persons can observe the
behaviour of an individual on the same video recording or measure the
trait at close to the same time).
</p>
<b>Statistical model:</b>
<p>
Because the environmental effect in this scenario was unknown, the
statistical models are the same as before, with two exceptions.<br />
First, the phenotypic equation is as before,
</p>
<p>$$y_{hi}=I_i+e_{hi}$$</p>
<p>
except that <span class="math inline">\(e_{hi}\)</span> contains both
measurement error and deviations described by <span
class="math inline">\(\beta x_{hi}\)</span>
</p>
<p><p>The variance equation is now</p><p>$$V_P=V_I+V_R$$</p><p>where</p><p>$$V_R=V_{\beta x}+V_m$$</p></p>

<h3>Step 4: Explaining Environmental Variance</h3>
<p><b>Sub-goal:</b> to explain unknown environmental variance.</p>
<p>
<b>Introduction:</b> In step 3, we introduced <span
class="math inline">\(V_{\beta x}\)</span> as the variance caused by the
environment. We did not know what that effect was (it was unmeasured),
but often we can measure the environment and assess its influence on
phenotype. In this step, we demonstrate how that is done.
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise:</b> As before, we will generate a new group of individuals,
with phenotypic variance caused by measurement error <span
class="math inline">\((V_m)\)</span>, individual differences <span
class="math inline">\((V_I)\)</span>, and specific and measured
(i.e. known) environmental effects <span class="math inline">\((V_{\beta

<span class="math inline">\(V_m\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(V_I\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(V_{\beta x}\)</span>, but we suggest you use the
same values you did in Step 3. Remember that these variances must add up
to 1.
</p>
<div style="clear:both; text-align:center">
<img id="logo" src="images/underConstruction_pic.png" align="center" alt="Modules" width=120px height=120px>
</div>
<p>
At this point, we want to expand on the idea of statistical models. The
equations that specify effects producing each individual data point can
be hypotheses about the real world. In the made-up world of SQuID, these
analysis models have the potential of recreating it exactly. The real
world is different and most of the lessons we will cover have to do with
problems in estimating terms in analysis models when much is unknown.
For now, we will specify a model that should recreate our simulated set
of effects completely (with the caveat that we are sampling from an
infinite population so observed values will differ from input values).
This new model will make explicit as well that <span
class="math inline">\(I_i\)</span> is defined as the deviation of each
individual from a population value. Until now, that population value has
implicitly been 0, so we haven’t used it. But, since we are now
including a slope term that allows us to explain environmental
variation, it is important to also introduce the population intercept
term. For now, we will still have the population mean be = 0, but it is
appropriate to include this intercept in all equations because it could
be some other value. The model is:
</p>
<p>$$y_{hi}=\beta_0+I_i+\beta x_{hi} +e_{hi}$$</p>
<p>
where <span class="math inline">\(y_{hi}\)</span> is the phenotype
measured at the <span class="math inline">\(h^{th}\)</span> time for the
<span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> individual, <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> is the population mean phenotype,
<span class="math inline">\(I_i\)</span> is the individual mean
deviation from the population mean for the <span
class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> individual, <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is the population mean effect of
measured environment <span class="math inline">\(x_{hi}\)</span> on the
measure of phenotype, and <span class="math inline">\(e_{hi}\)</span> is
the error made in that measurement.
</p>
<p>
A mixed statistical model estimates these parameters:
</p>
<p>
Visually, you can see what <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is
in the following graph:
</p>
<p>
The variance among individuals can still be visualized in this world by
plotting each individual's dataset and line.
</p>
<p>
We encourage you to go back and play around with the magnitude of <span
class="math inline">\(V_m\)</span> to see how it affects estimates of
<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(V_I\)</span>. You can also play around with the
slope and the ratio of <span class="math inline">\(V_{\beta x}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(V_I\)</span> to better understand the
effects.
</p>
<p>
<b>Point:</b> This exercise introduced explanatory variables (also known
as fixed effects). Because individual is a “random” effect, this is thus
a “mixed effects” model. The fixed effect part is a linear regression.
Even if this is all you want to do with your data, it is important to
understand that a sampling regime in which individuals are measured more
than once creates the need to do linear regression within a mixed model.
Although we do not focus much on significance testing here, the
structure of data collected in this simulation strongly affects
inferences based on hypothesis testing. More importantly, the
combination of random effects and fixed effects sets one up to
investigate a wide array of processes involved at one or more levels in
this hierarchal structure of among versus within-individual variance.

<h3>Step 1: The biology that produces binary, proportional, and count
data</h3>
<p>
<b>Sub-goal:</b> Introducing how biology may result in non-normally
distributed data.
</p>
<p>
Introduction: Before you start analyzing your data, one thing you want
to consider is the biology of what you’re looking at and the how the
phenomenon you’re interested in is expressed by organisms. Most of the
statistical methods we’re familiar with make assumptions about how data
are distributed (or, really, how errors are distributed), specifically
they assume that our data are normally distributed (i.e., having a
Gaussian error structure). However, is this always an appropriate
assumption?
</p>
<p>
While the assumption of normality (in residuals) may work in many
instances, it is also easy to think of biological traits that clearly
don’t fit this framework. For example, the sex-ratio of your offspring
will not be something that can be measured in such a way that the data
would be normally distributed and thus can’t be analyzed with typical
models. This is most apparent in species with temperature-dependent sex
determination where the temperature an egg is incubated at determines
whether it is female or male :
</p>
<div style="clear:both; text-align:center">
<img src="images/Alligator_mississippiensis.jpg" alt="Alligator mississippiensis" width=50% height=50%>
</div>
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_alligator'><i>Alligator
mississippiensis</i></a>, a species that exhibits temperature-dependent
sex determination.<br>
<div style="clear:both; text-align:center">
<img id="logo" src="images/underConstruction_pic.png" align="center" alt="Modules" width=120px height=120px>
</div>
<p>
As you can see from playing with the temperature at which a clutch of
American alligators is incubated, sex ratio does not conform to a normal
distribution and so using something like a regression to understand how
temperature affects sex ratio would be inappropriate.
</p>
<p>
A simpler case than this one is one where sex is determined via
particular combinations of allosomes (i.e. sex chromosomes). In such
cases the sex of offspring will be determined via what’s known as a
Bernoulli process. As an example, let’s consider how the coin-flip
process of genetic sex determination interacts with the number of
coin-flips to give a distribution of sexes:
</p>
<div style="clear:both; text-align:center">
<img id="logo" src="images/underConstruction_pic.png" align="center" alt="Modules" width=120px height=120px>
</div>
<p>
The outcome of a single coin flip, like that for a single egg,
represents what is known as binary data, i.e., this data takes the form
of 1 or 0 (A or B, female or male, etc.). Many other biological
processes take a similar form: at a particular instance one of two
outcomes is possible. Importantly, this process also works when the odds
of either outcome are not 50/50:
</p>
<p>
This situation is now starting to approach what we saw with
temperature-dependent sex determination: the trait we’re measuring is
always one of two conditions (e.g. female or male) but the probability
of either condition is not 0.5 and, in fact, is dependent on some other
environmental condition. Many biological traits are expressed in binary
terms. This includes traits expressed repeatedly over one’s lifetime,
e.g., whether a bird mates during a particular breeding season or
whether a plant flowers during a particular year. As you’ll see in later
steps of this module, this Bernoulli process can be statistically
modelled using what is known as a binomial distribution restricted to
binary outcomes. For now, let’s consider some other types of
distributions and generating patterns we might see.
</p>
</div>
<div id="section-proportional-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Proportional Data</h3>
<p>What if instead of a single egg, we consider the sexes of a clutch of animals? 
    In this case the sex of each individual egg is the product of a Bernoulli process but 
    the data we might collect is actually in proportional form, e.g., proportion of males in the clutch. 
    In fact, we actually were plotting data in this sort of manner in all three of our figures above. 
    In this case what matters is the probability of either outcome and, as you saw above, 
    the number of coin flips (or eggs) and the probability of either of the two outcomes.</p>
<p>
<u>Exercise:</u> explore the effects of the number of coin
flips/eggs/trials and the probability.
</p>
<div style="clear:both; text-align:center">
<img id="logo" src="images/underConstruction_pic.png" align="center" alt="Modules" width=120px height=120px>
</div>
<p>
Many types of biological data might similarly be expressed as
proportions: for example, the proportion of seeds that successfully
germinate and the proportion of females in a group. This type of
proportional data is <b>binomially distributed</b>.
</p>
</div>
<div
id="section-when-proportional-data-are-not-from-a-binomial-distribution"
class="section level3">
<h3>When proportional data are not from a binomial distribution</h3>
<p>The important characteristic of the data types above is that they are generated via a Bernoulli process: 
    an egg is either female or male, a seed either germinates or it doesn't. 
    These outcomes are, generally, independent of each other and this is actually the key assumption for 
    analyzing proportional data. Importantly, data that is expressed or summarized as a proportion but 
    is not generated from a Bernoulli cannot be analyzed in the same manner. 
    For example, we might often express time spent performing a particular action as a proportion 
    but how we divide the time increments over which we record are typically not independent of each other. 
    For example, if an individual is currently foraging, it is likely still foraging 
    a second later but way less likely a week later. This distinction can be very important 
    in analyses and when data not generated by a Bernoulli processes are analyzed as a proportion, 
    any resulting p-values and confidence estimates will be inappropriate.</p>

<h3>Count
Data<div style="clear:both; text-align:center"><img id="logo" src="images/underConstruction_pic.png" align="center" alt="Modules" width=120px height=120px></div></h3>
<p>Besides binary proportional data, another major class of data is count data. 
    Examples include traits like how many clutches a bird has in a single year and how many 
    flowers a plant produces during a growing season. In both of these examples the key aspect 
    is that some act is performed or something is produced additively . The average production 
    over some sampling period (breeding season, life-time, etc.) is then the average of what is 
    known as a Poisson distribution, i.e. the rate ($\lambda$) of the Poisson process as discussed 
    in the next step of this module. This mean then determines the shape of resulting distribution:</p>

class="section level3">
<h3>Step 2: Introduction to Bernoulli, binomial and Poisson
distributions</h3>
<p>
<b>Sub-goal:</b> to learn statistical properties of the three key
non-Gaussian distributions.
</p>
<p>
Introduction: In Step 1, we considered biological scenarios where
non-Gaussian data could be produced. The three important types of data
are binary, proportional and count data, each of which corresponds to a
uniquely named statistical distribution, namely Bernoulli, binomial and
Poisson. Remember that a Gaussian (normal) distribution is characterized
by a mean (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>) and a variance
(<span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>). These two quantities are
called statistical parameters for the Gaussian distribution. Statistical
parameters for the three non-Gaussian distributions are not the mean and
variance (at least they are not called so). Let’s look at the
statistical parameters for each non-Gaussian distribution now.
</p>
<p>
A <b>Bernoulli</b> distribution is characterized by only one parameter,
p, which is often interpreted as a probability of success. Or more
biologically, for example, you can see it as the probability of female
offspring (see Step 1). More formally, we can write a trait <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, which follows a Bernoulli distribution
along with its mean (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>) and
variance (<span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>) as:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[y \sim Bernoulli(p)\]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[\mu = p\]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[V = p(1-p)\]</span>
</p>
<p>
A <b>binomial</b> distribution has one more statistical parameter, which
is m, the number of trials. A biological example is the number of
offspring in a brood (as <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>) with
the probability of female being <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.
More formally, we can write a proportional trait, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> as:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[y \sim binomial(m,p)\]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[y \sim binomial(m,p)\]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[y \sim binomial(m,p)\]</span>
</p>
<p>
As you can see a Bernoulli distribution is a special case of a binomial
distribution with m being 1. Like the Bernoulli distribution, the
<b>Poisson</b> distribution has only one statistical parameter. This
parameter is often called, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>
(termed the ‘rate’ parameter). We can formally write a count trait
following a Poisson distribution as:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[y \sim Poisson(\lambda)\]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[\mu = \lambda\]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[V = \lambda\]</span>
</p>
<p>
As you can see, the mean equals the variance in a Poisson distribution.
Also, for both Bernoulli and binomial distributions, the mean and
variance are also tightly related. In fact, a unique feature of a
Gaussian distribution is non-existence of the relationship between the
mean and variance. Non-Gaussian distributions, in general, have, what is
called, a mean-variance relationship. It may be interesting to note that
a binomial distribution becomes a form of a Poisson distribution when
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is very small because:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[V = mp(1-p) \approx mp = \mu\]</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise:</b> We explore the mean-variance relationship for Bernoulli
distributions with <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> ranging from 0
to 1.
</p>
<p>
We now do the same for Poisson distributions where <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> varies between 0.5 and 100.

<h3>Step 3: Introduction to generalized linear mixed-effect models
(GLMMs)</h3>
<p>
<b>Sub-goal:</b> to understand the idea of the link and inverse link
function and overdispersion and how (dis)similar it is to model Gaussian
and non-Gaussian traits.
</p>
<p>
<b>Introduction 1:</b> In other modules, we assumed the trait of
interest, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> follows a Gaussian
distribution and we used a mixed-effects modeling framework to partition
variance in <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. For a non-Gaussian
trait, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, somehow we would like to
make <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> normally distributed ,
removing the mean-variance relationship. Then, we could use the same
mixed-effects model framework we have been using in other modules so
far. This ‘transformation’ can be done using the ‘link’ function in
generalized linear models (GLMs) if y values are independent of each
other or in generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) when y values are
repeated measures or have a correlational structure. Also, the ‘inverse
link’ function can bring results from the ‘link’ scale (<span
class="math inline">\(y&#39;\)</span>) back to the original non-Gaussian
data scale. This link scale is often called as the latent scale. For
example, a commonly used link function for binary (and proportional)
data is the logit link function. The logit function and its inverse can
be written as:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[y \sim Bernoulli(p)\]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[logit(p) = ln(\frac{p}{1-p}) =
y^\prime\]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[logit^{-1}(y^\prime) = \frac{1}{1 +
e^{-y^\prime}} = p\]</span>
</p>
<p>
Unlike <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y^\prime\)</span> is assumed to follow a Gaussian
distribution.
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise 1:</b> To understand the concept of the link and inverse
link function better, we will simulate <span
class="math inline">\(y^\prime\)</span> (a non-Gaussian trait on the
latent scale) and convert simulated values first to <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and the non-Gaussian trait <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.

<p>
Note that we can get binary data from a normal distribution by using the
inverse link function and Bernoulli distributions. But the reverse
operation requires modeling (which we will practice below) because the
logit transformation of 0 and 1 is negative and positive infinity,
respectively.
</p>
<p>
<b>Introduction 2:</b> Another concept you need to learn for modeling
non-Gaussian data is overdispersion, which we will explain more below
(‘dispersion’ relates to variability of a distribution like variance but
it is a more general term). Imagine that we record the number of female
and male offspring that female animals have per breeding season across
the number of years (<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> being a
concatenation of female and male offspring per female <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and per season <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. Then, using the logit link function
with a binomial error structure, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>
can be expressed as a GLMM:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[y_{hi} \sim binomial(m_{hi},
p_{hi})\]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[p_{hi} = logit^{-1}(\beta_0 + I_i +
o_{hi})\]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[I_i \sim N(0,V_I)\]</span>
</p>
<p>
where logit<sup>-1</sup> is the inverse link function and ohi is
overdispersion, which is normally distributed as for the individual
effect <span class="math inline">\(I_i\)</span> (note that we skip the
notation <span class="math inline">\(y^\prime\)</span> which we used
above). All the key parameters (population mean <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> and individual-specific deviation
<span class="math inline">\(I_i\)</span>) are estimated on the latent
scale where random effects are (assumed to be) normally distributed. It
is also interesting to notice that <span
class="math inline">\(o_{hi}\)</span> is very much like <span
class="math inline">\(e_{hi}\)</span> (residuals), which we have seen in
other modules; in the statistical literature, <span
class="math inline">\(o\)</span> is known as additive (over)dispersion
because there is an alternative way of implementing dispersion known as
multiplicative overdispersion (for more details of additive and
multiplicative dispersion, see Nakagawa and Schielzeth 2010). The
overdispersion <span class="math inline">\(o_{hi}\)</span> is also known
as the observation-level random factor (effect) because the number of
categories of this random effect matches the number of data points, this
aspect is also somewhat analogous to the residuals in a normal
mixed-effects model.
</p>
<p>
Overall the GLMM above looks very much to normal mixed-effects models,
apart from the overdispersion and the (inverse) link function, which
connects <span class="math inline">\(p_{hi}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y_{hi}\)</span> via binomial distributions. For a
binary trait (dead or alive, male or female, present or absent), <span
class="math inline">\(m_{hi}\)</span> is always 1. Also <span

<b>Conclusion:</b> The underlying biology that generates phenotypes is
important to consider because not all biological processes will produce
Gaussian data. Deciding how you are going to analyze your data requires
that you consider how it was generated and this biology will determine
the types of analyses you conduct. Once we identify non-Gaussian data
such as binary, proportional and counts. Then, wee can use GLMMs to
model these data (with appropriate link function and error structure,
e.g., log link function with a Poisson error structure). On the latent
scale, we can estimate regression coefficients and variance components
just like how we model Gaussian data.

<h3>Step 1: Sampling and non-stochastic environment</h3>
<p>
<b>Sub-goal:</b> to explore how hidden patterns in environment combined
with variance in sampling affect estimates of variance parameters and
their interpretation.
</p>
<p>
<b>Introduction:</b> In the previous module (<i>Basic Lessons about
Variance</i>), we partitioned phenotypic variance into several
components (the variance among individuals, <span
class="math inline">\(V_I\)</span>, the variance caused by measurement
error, <span class="math inline">\(V_m\)</span>, and variance caused by
the environment, <span class="math inline">\(V_E\)</span>). In the final
step of that module, we illustrated how measurement of the environment
could help explain some of the variance. Often, when we study phenotypes
in natural populations, many aspects of the environment that could
affect phenotypes will be unknown and so not measured. In Step 3, this
unmeasured environmental variance ended up as “residual” variance, and
it had no effect on the estimate of among-individual variance because
the environment was randomly determined from one sampling period to
another and all individuals were sampled at the same time and
experienced the same environment. In the present module, we explore what
happens when we relax this obviously simplified assumption. For example,
suppose the environment changes steadily over the sampling period. What
happens when the pattern of how an investigator measures individuals
varies, such as if the timing of measurement is different for different
individuals?
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise:</b> As in previous simulations, we will generate a new
group of individuals, with phenotypic variation generated by measurement
error <span class="math inline">\((V_m)\)</span>, individual differences
<span class="math inline">\((V_I)\)</span>, and the impact of the a
specified environmental variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
which produces variance due to the environment <span
class="math inline">\((V_E)\)</span>. We have shifted to using the
notation <span class="math inline">\(V_E\)</span> here instead of <span
class="math inline">\(V_{\beta x}\)</span> which we used in Step 3 and 4
of the module “<i>Basic Lessons about Variance</i>”. We do this because
we will soon explore what happens when only some of the environmental
variance is known, and we will use <span class="math inline">\(V_{\beta
x}\)</span> for that known variance.
</p>
<p>
As before, you can set <span class="math inline">\(V_m\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(V_I\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(V_{E}\)</span>, and for this module, <span
class="math inline">\(V_{E}\)</span> must be greater than 0.
</p>
<div style="clear:both; text-align:center">
<img id="logo" src="images/underConstruction_pic.png" align="center" alt="Modules" width=120px height=120px>
</div>
<p>
The environment for this simulation is, for convenience, set as being
linear over time, affecting all individuals similarly (i.e., it is
“shared”). The environment is also expressed in unit variance (i.e.,
<span class="math inline">\(Var(x)=1\)</span>) and mean-centered (i.e.,
<span class="math inline">\(E(x)=0\)</span>).
</p>
<p>
You also must enter parameters for variance in the sampling timing
within and among individuals. For this simulation, the total number of
expressions of the phenotype from which you can sample is fixed at 100.
While you can vary the number of individual samples taken, for this
module to effectively illustrate the issues with sampling, the number of
samples must be much less than 100. The key parameter to be entered by
you will be the among-individual variance in timing of those records. To
illustrate, below are examples of sampling records for a small number of
individuals when the among-individual variance in sampling timing is 0,
and when it is 0.9.

</div>
<p>
<b>Results</b>
</p>
<p>
If we have no information about the environment, the model we
incorrectly assume to be true is:
</p>
<p><p>$$y_{hi}=I_i+e_{hi}$$</p></p>
<p>
A mixed-effects statistical model can then estimate these model
parameters:
</p>
<p>
The above should show that if the unmeasured environment changes over
time AND there is among-individual variance in sampling, then some of
the unknown <span class="math inline">\(V_E\)</span> is placed into
residual variance (making residual variance larger than just measurement
variance <span class="math inline">\(V_m\)</span>), and some ends up in
the estimated <span class="math inline">\(V_I\)</span>, also making it
bigger than it should be.
</p>
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
</p>
<p>
This exercise demonstrates that if there is among-individual variance in
timing of sampling, then estimates of <span
class="math inline">\(V_I\)</span> will be incorrect since inevitably
there are systematic differences in environments over time. Sampling
biases thus can produce “pseudo-personality” or “pseudo-repeatability”
(see also
<a href='http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.12013/abstract' target='_blank'>Dingemanse
&amp; Dochtermann 2013</a>) and could mislead a researcher into
believing there are consistent differences between individuals when
there are none (or they are much smaller than it appears).
</p>
<p>
Because among-individual variance in sampling and systematic changes in
environment are extremely likely in real systems, how can we get
accurate estimates of <span class="math inline">\(V_I\)</span>?
</p>
<p>
We explore one solution to this problem:
<ol>
<li>
Adjust sampling regime to minimize it (go to Step 2)
</li>
<li>
Accounting for biases in your analysis (go to Step 3)

<h3>Step 2: Sampling to reduce effects of non-stochastic
environment</h3>
<p>
<b>Sub-goal:</b> Using simulations to generate sampling regimes that
limit the effects of non-stochastic environments.
</p>
<p>
<b>Introduction:</b> Step 1 revealed a problem—non-stochastic
environments through time and variability in the timing of sampling can
create biases in estimates of among-individual variation. In this step
we encourage you to adjust the sampling regime to minimize this problem.
It should be obvious that if all individuals are sampled with the same
timing, then the bias in the estimates of among-individual variance
disappears, but it is worthwhile assessing how close one has to be to
identical sampling and whether there are biases in other parameters that
remain. So, in this step we will allow you to simulate several types of
non-stochastic environments and adjust the sampling regime.
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise:</b> As in Step 1, we will generate a new group of
individuals, with phenotypic variance caused by measurement error <span
class="math inline">\((V_m)\)</span>, individual differences <span
class="math inline">\((V_I)\)</span>, and the impact of the environment
<span class="math inline">\((V_E)\)</span>.

<img id="logo" src="images/underConstruction_pic.png" align="center" alt="Modules" width=120px height=120px>
</div>
<p>
You now get to set the environment. In Step 1 of this module, we used an
environment that w as experienced similarly by all individuals
(“shared”) and which changed systematically over time. Below, you can
change these settings to have environments that each individual
experiences uniquely (“unshared”), and which changes over time as some
other function (e.g., stochastically or as a regressive autocorrelated
decay function).
</p>
<div style="clear:both; text-align:center">
<img id="logo" src="images/underConstruction_pic.png" align="center" alt="Modules" width=120px height=120px>
</div>
<p>
As in step 1, you also must enter parameters for variance in the
sampling timing within and among individuals. As before, the number of
expressions of the phenotype will be set by us at 100, so keep this in
mind as you enter values here.
</p>
<p>
The figure below shows time of sampling of a subset of individuals
according to the values entered.
</p>
<p>
<b>Results</b>
</p>
<p>
As before, the model we assume to be true (but which is not since the
environmental effect is not included) is:
</p>
<p>$$y_{hi}=I_i+e_{hi}$$</p>
<p>
A mixed statistical model estimates the parameters which we can compare
with the true values:
</p>
<div style="clear:both; text-align:center">
<img id="logo" src="images/underConstruction_pic.png" align="center" alt="Modules" width=120px height=120px>
</div>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
The results of any given simulation may vary, but the overall picture
that emerges if you do several simulations should be that your estimates
are better when <span class="math inline">\(V_E\)</span> is small, as
you measure each individual more often, and your sampling time is
increasingly similar among individuals.
</p>
<p>
Did you simulate a population where the environment is not shared among
individuals? If not, try it now. What you should find is that no matter
what the sampling regime, your estimate of <span
class="math inline">\(V_I\)</span> is too high. To understand, let’s
return to the definitions of the variance components: We defined <span
class="math inline">\(V_I\)</span> as the variance among individuals
that permanently affected their phenotype throughout the sampling
period. Biologically, this can be ascribed to genetic differences or
environments acting during development (e.g., before measurements
started). When environments are unshared during sampling, the
environment is affecting the phenotype each time it is expressed.
However, because the environment is autocorrelated across sampling
episodes and differs among individuals, apparent individual differences
arise because individuals are in different environments not because they
entered the time period of phenotypic expression differing in their
phenotype (note: You may be thinking that since individuals in the real
world partially choose their environment then their phenotype is not
solely due to the environment. That is true but does not change the fact
that for the focal trait it is sensitive to the environment the
individual is in each time it is expressed. We will get to the issue of
multiple phenotypic characters and how they might integrate in the
“<i>Multiple traits</i>” module).
</p>
<p>
To conclude for this step, if you do not know what environments are
affecting trait expression, sampling in parallel for all individuals is
a possible solution to potential biases created by non-stochastic
environments. But, because unshared environments can create biases even
with identical sampling (and often identical sampling will be nearly
impossible to achieve), the only other solution is to measure the
environment and account for possible biases explicitly. This is explored
next in Step 3.

<h3>Step 3: Biased sampling and known and unknown environments</h3>
<p>
<b>Sub-goal:</b> Accounting for the environment to control for
environmental biases.
</p>
<p>
<b>Introduction:</b> Step 1 of this module illustrated that
environmental effects on phenotypes can produce biases in estimates of
among-individual variance <span
class="math inline">\((V_I)\)</span>.<br />
Step 2 explored how altering sampling regimes could reduce this problem
but also revealed that in some circumstances no sampling regime would
work. Sometimes individuals experience different environments, and no
sampling regime can adjust for that. However, if investigators can
measure the environment, then such differences could be accounted for.
Environmental variance was accounted for using linear regression in step
4 of the “<i>Basic Lessons about Variance</i>” module. Here we
demonstrate that this can, under some circumstances, solve the bias in
sampling problem.
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise 1:</b> This exercise follows the same structure as all of
our other simulations so far. We will generate a group of individuals,
with phenotypic variance caused by measurement error <span
class="math inline">\((V_m)\)</span>, individual differences <span
class="math inline">\((V_I)\)</span>, and the impact of the environment
<span class="math inline">\((V_E)\)</span>. So, first set the true
values of these variances:

<img id="logo" src="images/underConstruction_pic.png" align="center" alt="Modules" width=120px height=120px>

The environment can be chosen as in Step 2. It, combined with the
sampling regime, will affect within- and among-individual variance in
the environment.

<p>
Finally, we will have you set how much of the environmental variance has
been measured and is therefore known. You will select a proportion, from
0 to 1 of this variance. This proportion along with the proportion of
total variance that is environmental will determine the correlation
between phenotype and the known environment. The results of Step 1
should have shown you what happens when all the environmental variance
is unknown (or not included in your statistical model). Here, let’s
start with all the environmental variance being known and measurable.

This should show you that when there is among-individual variance in
sampling and you can account for all the environmental variance with an
x variable, any bias in <span class="math inline">\(V_I\)</span> caused
by the biased sampling disappears.
</p>
<p>
A brief reminder about notation: When unknown environments affect
phenotypic variance, we have referred to that variance as <span
class="math inline">\(V_E\)</span>. In the model where the environment
is known <span class="math inline">\((x)\)</span>, there now is a
specific component of variance due to that known environmental factor,
<span class="math inline">\(V_{\beta x}\)</span>. In the case above,
<span class="math inline">\(V_E=V_{\beta x}\)</span>, but in the real
world with many environmental variables, <span
class="math inline">\(V_{\beta x}\)</span> will be only a fraction of
<span class="math inline">\(V_E\)</span>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise 2:</b> Now, let’s repeat the same simulation as above,

If you want, you can also change the level of bias in sampling.

the values estimated when the environment is unknown, and those
estimated when some portion of the environment is known and included in
the model.

<img id="logo" src="images/underConstruction_pic.png" align="center" alt="Modules" width=120px height=120px>
</div>
<p>
<b>Conclusion:</b> There are two lessons that emerge from this exercise.
First, biases in sampling are usually inevitable, but measuring the
underlying environments that differ among individuals can reduce them.
Thus, if you want to measure among-individual variance, you must think
carefully about potential biases in environments, and measure those
environments. That will give you a better estimate of among-individual
variance.
</p>
<p>
The second lesson is that bias in sampling may occur without you being
aware of it. This unknown environment will affect your estimate of
among-individual variance. Put another way, any among-individual
variance estimated from real data could be due to unknown biased
environments. One cannot be sure that you have accounted for all of the
environmental variance. The <span class="math inline">\(V_I\)</span>
that is found from real data must therefore be interpreted cautiously.
</p>
<p>
<b>A final caveat:</b> An interesting consequence of having variance in
sampling among individuals is that it produces variance in the
experienced environment that exists both within and among individuals.
We have assumed that the impact of the environmental variance that
exists among individuals is the same as that of the variance in
environment within-individuals. As an example, individuals may be on
territories with different average levels of resources through the whole
period of time you are taking measurements, and those resources may
fluctuate some from day to day as well. Thus in your population, there
is both among-individual variance in environment (e.g., differences
between territories) and within-individual variance in environment
(differences between days within a territory). We have assumed these
have the same effect on phenotype. It is possible that this is not the
case. If so, the method we have demonstrated here will not give accurate
estimates of <span class="math inline">\(V_I\)</span>. We discuss one
solution to this in a module on within and among-subject centering. The
issues related to centering are complex, so we recommend this module be
done after the module on random regression.

<h3>Step 1: Phenotypic correlations between two repeatedly expressed
traits that are not consistently different between individuals.</h3>
<p>
<b>Sub-goal:</b> Introducing within-individual correlations and
variance-covariance matrices
</p>
<p>
<b>Introduction:</b> As we have seen in other modules (Basic Lessons
about Variance, Random regressions), repeatedly expressed traits can
vary both within and among individuals. In this module, we apply the
same logic to correlations between traits. We do this by introducing the
notion that correlations also exist at multiple hierarchical levels.
Importantly, we explain how the correlations existing at each level
influence the overall phenotypic correlation in the data, and how their
influence is mediated by the amount of variation occurring at each
level. We will introduce these ideas one step at the time; we will start
with focussing on two repeatedly expressed traits that do not vary among
individuals. In other words, those two traits only harbour
within-individual variation.
</p>
<p>
As a worked example, we consider two traits that we expect to be
correlated because of trade-offs. For example, trait <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> may represent egg size while trait
<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> represents egg number (i.e.,
clutch size). We expect trade-offs in the investment in these two traits
because females producing large eggs should typically have fewer
resources available for producing a large clutch. This means that we
expect a negative correlation within the same individual parent between
egg size (<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>) and egg number (<span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>).
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise:</b> We will generate multi-level data for two repeatedly
expressed traits. We will consider a scenario where the two traits are
assayed simultaneously for a set of individuals. All individuals are
sampled repeatedly but at the same time. We are assuming that you will
sample 10 individuals with 10 samples per individual throughout. In this
exercise, we use the following models:
</p>
<p>
Set the amount of within-individual variance in each of the two traits
(<span class="math inline">\(V_{e_y}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(V_{e_z}\)</span>):
</p>
<p>
Now set the within-individual correlation. Remember, for this example
this correlation should be negative as we are considering trade-offs
between egg size (<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>) and egg number
(<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>).
</p>
<p>
Above, you have defined the elements of the within-individual
“variance-covariance matrix”.<br />
This matrix holds the variances of the two traits on the diagonals and
their covariance on the off-diagonals:
</p>
<p>

trait <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(Cov_{e_y,e_z}\)</span> the within-individual
covariance between these two traits. Notably, you did not enter the
covariance (<span class="math inline">\(Cov_{e_y,e_z}\)</span>) between
the two traits but rather their correlation. As you will learn later on
in this module, covariances are important for various calculations (see
below), which is why we introduce them here. The correlation is the
covariance between the two traits when the associated variances are
expressed in standard deviation units. This therefore results in a
standardized metric that can be compared across samples differing in
variance. The relationship between the within-individual correlation
(<span class="math inline">\(r_{e_y,e_z}\)</span>) and covariance (<span
class="math inline">\(Cov_{e_y,e_z}\)</span>) is:
</p>
<p>
Note that the relationship between the two traits should be negative if
you did enter a negative correlation above, and that this relationship
exists within individuals. That is, when a female (colour) increases egg
size from one instance (e.g. year) to the next, she simultaneously
decreases her egg number. In other words, the changes in one trait
across repeated expressions of the same individual are associated with
changes in another trait.
</p>
<p>
<b>Conclusion:</b> Variance-covariance matrices hold information on the
amount of variance existing in each trait as well as the covariances
between them. The correlations between two traits are calculated using
this information on variances and covariances as derived metrics.

<h3>Step 2: Phenotypic correlations between two repeatedly expressed
traits that also differ consistently between individuals.</h3>
<p>
<b>Introduction:</b> In step one, we focussed on within-individual
correlations caused by trade-offs between two costly traits that were
repeatedly expressed within the same individual. We assumed for
simplicity that both traits harboured no among-individual variance. This
meant that the individual repeatability was zero for both traits (see
module on <i>Basic Lessons about Variance</i> for an introduction to
repeatability). We will now consider a more complex but realistic
scenario where these two traits (egg size and egg number) varied both
within- and among-individuals, as we know is the case in natural
populations. The models for this step will be:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[y_{hi} = I_{yi} +
                                                                                                             e_{yhi}\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[z_{hi} = I_{zi} +
                                                                                                             e_{zhi}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
For example, female passerine birds often adjust their clutch size to
changes in breeding density while females also differ consistently in
clutch sizes across repeated breeding attempts (Nicolaus <i>et al.</i>
2013). Previously, because the traits did not harbour any
among-individual variation, all variation in the data existed at
within-individuals. This meant that the phenotypic correlation between
the two traits in the dataset was identical to the within-individual
correlation. We can see why this is the case by introducing the equation
that describes the components affecting the phenotypic correlation
(<span class="math inline">\(r_{P_y,P_z}\)</span>) (e.g. Dingemanse
&amp; Dochtermann 2013; Dingemanse <i>et al.</i> 2012 ):
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[r_{P_y,P_z}
=  r_{I_y,I_z}\sqrt{(\frac{V_{I_y}}{V_{I_y} +
V_{e_y}})(\frac{V_{I_z}}{V_{I_z} + V_{e_z}})} +
r_{e_y,e_z}\sqrt{(\frac{V_{e_y}}{V_{I_y} +
V_{e_y}})(\frac{V_{e_z}}{V_{I_z} + V_{e_z}})}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
This monster contains several important elements. The phenotypic
correlation (<span class="math inline">\(r_{P_y,P_z}\)</span>) is
affected by both the among-individual correlation (<span
class="math inline">\(r_{I_y,I_z}\)</span>) # and the within-individual
correlation (<span class="math inline">\(r_{e_y,e_z}\)</span>). This
former correlation will be addressed in more detail in step 3 of this
module. Important for now is to note that the impact of each correlation
on the phenotypic correlation is weighted by the following term:
</p>
<p>
This term is called the “geometric mean repeatability” as it represents
the square-root of product of the repeatability of trait y <span
class="math inline">\((\frac{V_{I_y}}  {V_{I_y} + V_{e_y}})\)</span> and
trait z <span class="math inline">\((\frac{V_{I_z}}  {V_{I_z} +
V_{e_z}})\)</span> . Note that the term <span
class="math inline">\(\sqrt{  (\frac{V_{e_y}}  {V_{I_y} +
V_{e_y}})  (\frac{V_{e_z}}  {V_{I_z} + V_{e_z}})}\)</span> essentially
represents one minus this geometric repeatability and that both terms
add up to the value of 1. This means that for two traits that are highly
repeatable (e.g. sets of morphological traits), the phenotypic
correlation will largely reflect the among-individual correlation,
whereas for two traits that have a low repeatability (e.g. sets of
behavioural traits), the phenotypic correlation instead largely reflects
the within-individual correlation (Dingemanse &amp; Dochtermann 2013).
</p>
<p>
Let us now return to the example dataset that we considered in Step 1,
where we focussed on two repeatedly expressed traits that were
negatively correlated within-individuals but did not harbour any
among-individual variance.
</p>
<p>
We reprint the equation describing the components shaping the phenotypic
correlation:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[r_{P_y,P_z} =
r_{I_y,I_z}\sqrt{(\frac{V_{I_y}}{V_{I_y} +
V_{e_y}})(\frac{V_{I_z}}{V_{I_z} + V_{e_z}})} +
r_{e_y,e_z}\sqrt{(\frac{V_{e_y}}{V_{I_y} +
V_{e_y}})(\frac{V_{e_z}}{V_{I_z} + V_{e_z}})}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
We have automatically taken forward your inputs from step 1, where you
have set the within-individual variances for traits y and z as well as
their covariance but where you assumed that the among-individual
variances (<span class="math inline">\(V_{I_y}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(V_{I_z}\)</span>) were equal to zero. What you
should note is that the geometric mean repeatability (defined above) is
equal to zero, while one minus this metric is equal to one, in cases
such as these where at least one of the traits harbours no
among-individual variance; therefore:<span
class="math display">\[r_{P_y,P_z} = r_{e_y,e_z}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise:</b>We will now introduce among-individual variance in both
egg size (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(V_{I_y}&gt;0\)</span>) and
clutch size (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(V_{I_y}&gt;0\)</span>).
For simplicity, we will assume that an individual’s average egg size
over all its repeated observations is not correlated with its average
clutch size over all its repeated observations, i.e., that the
among-individual correlation is zero. As in step 1 above, we have set
both the number of individuals, and the number of repeated measures per
individual, to 10.
</p>
<p>
You have now also defined the values for the among-individual matrix:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[ \Omega_{I}=\begin{pmatrix}V_{I_y} &amp;
Cov_{I_y,I_z}\\Cov_{I_y,I_z} &amp; V_{I_z} \\\end{pmatrix}\]</span>
</p>
<div style="clear:both; text-align:center">
<img id="logo" src="images/underConstruction_pic.png" align="center" alt="Modules" width=120px height=120px>
</div>
<p>
As you have set both the among- and within-individual variances, you
have defined the repeatabilities of both traits. As detailed in module
on Basic Lessons about Variance, repeatability ranges between 0 and 1
and is calculated as:
</p>
<p>
<span
class="math display">\[Repeatability=\frac{V&#39;_I}{V&#39;_I+V&#39;_e}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
We will now return to the equation that describes the components that
shape the phenotypic correlation:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[r_{P_y,P_z} =
r_{I_y,I_z}\sqrt{(\frac{V_{I_y}}{V_{I_y} +
V_{e_y}})(\frac{V_{I_z}}{V_{I_z} + V_{e_z}})} +
r_{e_y,e_z}\sqrt{(\frac{V_{e_y}}{V_{I_y} +
V_{e_y}})(\frac{V_{e_z}}{V_{I_z} + V_{e_z}})}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
Note that the phenotypic correlation (<span
class="math inline">\(r_{P_y,P_z}\)</span>) no longer matches the
within-individual correlation (<span
class="math inline">\(r_{e_y,e_z}\)</span>). This is because both traits
now harbour non-zero repeatability; as we have set the among-individual
correlation (<span class="math inline">\(r_{I_y,I_z}\)</span>) to zero,
in this specific scenario, we can simplify the equation into:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[r_{P_y,P_z} =
r_{e_y,e_z}\sqrt{(\frac{V_{e_y}}{V_{I_y} +
V_{e_y}})(\frac{V_{e_z}}{V_{I_z} + V_{e_z}})}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
Doing so clarifies that the geometric mean repeatability of the two
traits defines how well the phenotypic correlation in the data
corresponds to the within-individual correlation occurring because of
the presumed trade-off between investments in egg size vs. number. The
equation also clarifies that the more repeatable the two traits are, the
less apparent is the trade-off if one would focus solely on the overall
phenotypic correlation. This insight can be visualized by presenting
your data in two scatter plots. The first scatter plot shows the
correlation between the two traits that your entries (of within- and
among-individual variances and covariances) above produced. The second
scatter plot also uses your entries but assumes that you entered zero
among-individual variances. This second plot therefore depicts the
correlation in your data at the within-individual level alone. The first
graph should show a weaker overall phenotypic association as explained
above.
</p>
<p>
<b>Conclusion:</b> The phenotypic correlation reflects the
within-individual correlation when measured for repeatedly expressed
traits; however, their correspondence is a function of how repeatable
the two traits are. You may explore this idea more fully by re-running
the exercise for different levels of trait repeatabilities.

<h3>Step 3: Level-specific correlations.</h3>
<p>
<b>Sub-goal:</b> Understanding the role of level-specific correlations
in shaping phenotypic correlations in repeatedly expressed traits.
</p>
<p>
<b>Introduction:</b> As a final step in our analysis of the
within-individual trade-off between egg and clutch size, we will
introduce another level of complexity. We will consider the idea that
correlations often differ between hierarchical levels because of
multiple mechanisms shaping phenotypic correlations. We will continue
our example where individuals have to allocate limited resources into
multiple costly traits, causing negative within-individual correlations
due to trade-offs. We will now introduce the notion that there is a
second mechanism causing covariance, namely among-individual variation
in the acquisition of resources. This may lead to a situation where
individuals with many resources are able to produce both large eggs and
large clutches whereas individuals with fewer resources produce small
eggs and small clutches instead. Variation in acquisition combined with
allocation trade-offs therefore will lead to level-specific associations
(van Noordwijk &amp; de Jong 1986). In statistical terms, an
individual’s average egg size will correlate positively with its average
clutch size over all its expressions. Essentially, what we have now set
up is a situation where the correlations between egg size and number are
opposite across hierarchical levels.
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise:</b> Set the within- and among-individual variances for the
two traits. We suggest that you create a dataset where the associated
repeatabilities are 0.5 as this will result in a situation where the
phenotypic correlation is affected equally by correlations at each of
the two levels. You will also have to set the within- and
among-individual correlation. We suggest that you start with setting
them to the same value but with opposite signs (e.g. within: <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>=-0.5 vs. between <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>=+0.5). As in step 1, we have already
set both the number of individuals, and the number of repeated measures
per individual, to 10.

<p>
<b>Results</b>: You have defined the elements of the within-individual
“variance-covariance matrix”:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[ \Omega_{e}=\begin{pmatrix}V_{e_y} &amp;
Cov_{e_y,e_z}  \\Cov_{e_y,e_z} &amp; V_{e_z} \\\end{pmatrix}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
You have now also defined the elements of the among-individual matrix:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[ \Omega_{I}=\begin{pmatrix}V_{I_y} &amp;
Cov_{I_y,I_z}  \\Cov_{I_y,I_z} &amp; V_{I_z} \\\end{pmatrix}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
We will now again return to the equation describing the components
affecting the phenotypic correlation:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[r_{P_y,P_z} = r_{I_y,I_z} \sqrt{
(\frac{V_{I_y}}{V_{I_y} + V_{e_y}})(\frac{V_{I_z}}{V_{I_z} + V_{e_z}})}
+ r_{e_y,e_z}\sqrt{(\frac{V_{e_y}}{V_{I_y} +
V_{e_y}})(\frac{V_{e_z}}{V_{I_z} + V_{e_z}})}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
Note that if you have entered different values for the within-individual
correlation ($r_{
</p>
<p>
Another issue that you may investigate by changing the entry values
above is the role of repeatability. You may for example choose within-
and among-individual correlations of equal strength but opposite sign
(e.g. -0.8 vs. 0.8) for a range of different repeatabilities. You could
also play with creating a dataset where one trait has a high and another
trait has a low repeatability. You will find that when both traits are
highly repeatable, the phenotypic correlation will more closely reflect
the among-individual correlation. By contrast, if both traits have a low
repeatability, the phenotypic correlation will more closely reflect the
within-individual correlations. But how can we visualize the patterns of
correlation within vs. among individuals? We can do this by producing
three types of scatter plots. First, we can simply plot the raw data in
a scatter plot; this plot represents the overall phenotypic association
between the two traits. Second, we can calculate each individual’s mean
value for each of the two traits, and plot these two values in a scatter
plot. This plot of individual-mean values represents a visual of the
among-individual correlation. Third, we can calculate how each
observation deviates from an individual’s mean value for each of the two
traits, and plot these two values in a scatter plot. This plot of
within-individual deviations from individual-means represents a visual
of the within-individual correlation.
</p>
<p>
<b>Conclusion:</b> Repeatedly expressed traits often vary across
multiple hierarchical levels, such as within and among individuals. This
means that the phenotypic correlation summarizes the correlations
existing at different levels but that their respective influences are
weighted by the amount of variance existing at each level. In other
words, the correlation between two traits that have low repeatabilities
(e.g. physiology, behaviour) will largely represent within-individual
correlations, whereas correlations between traits that have high
repeatabilities (e.g. morphology) will largely represent
among-individual correlations. For this reason it is important to
partition the phenotypic correlation into its underlying components when
one is interested in level-specific patterns of correlations, such as
correlations within individuals due to trade-offs.

<h3>Step 4: The Bivariate mixed-effects model.</h3>
<p>
<b>Sub-goal:</b> Understanding the difference between a univariate and a
multivariate mixed-effects model, and how level-specific correlations
are modelled.
</p>
<p>
<b>Introduction:</b> In the previous modules (Basic Lessons about
Variance, Non-stochastic environments, and Random regressions) we have
considered univariate mixed-effects models. As you have seen, the
univariate mixed-effects model enabled us to estimate the variance
attributable to variation within- and among-individuals in a single
trait (y) with the following equation:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[y_{hi} = (\beta_0 + I_i) + e_{hi}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
The variation in intercepts (<span class="math inline">\(V_I\)</span>)
among individuals was assumed to be normally distributed (N) with a mean
of zero and a variance (<span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{I}\)</span>)
and is called the <i>among-individual variance</i> (estimated as <span
class="math inline">\(V_I\)</span>: the variance across random
intercepts of individuals):
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[[I_i] \sim N(0, \Omega_{I}): \Omega_{I} =
[V_I]\]</span>
</p>
<p>
A residual error (<span class="math inline">\(e_{hi}\)</span>) was also
assumed to be normally distributed, with zero mean and a variance (<span
class="math inline">\(\Omega_{e}\)</span>) representing the
<i>within-individual variance</i>:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[[e_{hi}] \sim N(0, \Omega_{e}): \Omega_{e}
= [V_e]\]</span>
</p>
<p>
In the bivariate mixed-effects models, we are estimating these
parameters simultaneously for two traits. That is, the model can be
formulated as a set of two phenotypic equations (one for <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and one for <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>):
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[y_{hi} = (\beta_{0y} + I_{yi}) +
e_{yhi}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[z_{hi} = (\beta_{0z} +
I_{zi}) + e_{zhi}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
As was the case for univariate models, the random intercepts (<span
class="math inline">\(I_i\)</span>) and the within-individual
contributions (<span class="math inline">\(e_{hi}\)</span>) to y and z
are modelled as having means of zero. However, in this bivariate case,
neither the random intercepts nor the residual errors are independent.
Instead, the random intercepts are now distributed assuming a
multivariate normal distribution with a variance-covariance structure
(<span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{I}\)</span>) specifying the
among-individual variances (<span class="math inline">\(V_{I_y}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(V_{I_z}\)</span>) and the
among-individual covariance between the two attributes (<span
class="math inline">\(Cov_{I_y,I_z}\)</span>):
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[ \Omega_{I}=\begin{pmatrix}V_{I_y} &amp;
Cov_{I_y,I_z}\\Cov_{I_y,I_z} &amp; V_{I_z}\\\end{pmatrix} \]</span>
</p>
<p>
The residual errors (<span class="math inline">\(e_{hi}\)</span>) are
likewise assumed to be drawn from a multivariate normal distribution,
with means of zero, within-individual variances (<span
class="math inline">\(V_{e_y}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(V_{e_z}\)</span>), and within-individual
covariances (<span class="math inline">\(Cov_{e_{y},e_{z}}\)</span>):
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[ \Omega_{e}=\begin{pmatrix}V_{e_y} &amp;
Cov_{e_y,e_z}  \\Cov_{e_y,e_z} &amp; V_{e_z} \\\end{pmatrix}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
From these estimated matrices, we can calculate the phenotypic variances
for each trait by adding up the variances estimated at each level:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[V_{P_y} = V_{I_y} + V_{e_y}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[V_{P_z} = V_{I_z} + V_{e_z}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
In the same fashion, we can calculate the phenotypic covariance between
the two traits by adding up the covariances estimated at each level:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[Cov_{P_y, P_z} = Cov_{I_y,I_z}
+  Cov_{e_y,e_z}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
With this information in hand, we can now calculate the overall
phenotypic correlation in the data:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[r_{P_y, P_z} =
                     \frac{Cov_{P_y,P_z}}
                     {\sqrt{V_{P_y}V_{P_z}}}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>Conclusion: </b>Bivariate mixed-effects models differ distinctly from
univariate mixed-effects models as the former assumes multivariate
normality while the latter assumes univariate normality. Bivariate
mixed-effects models estimate variances and covariances within and among
each specified level from which overall phenotypic variances and
covariances, as well as correlation, can be subsequently derived.

<h3>Step 5: Environmentally-induced correlations.</h3>
<p>
<b>Sub-goal:</b> Introducing integration of plasticity as a mechanism
causing correlations.
</p>
<p>
<b>Introduction:</b> In the previous steps we have, considered a
bivariate phenotypic equation where two traits correlated among- and/or
within-individuals without considering plasticity as a mechanism causing
this variation. This is why the double equation that we re-print here
harboured no fixed effects apart from the statistical intercepts:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[y_{hi} = (\beta_{0y} + I_{yi}) +
e_{yhi}\]</span><span class="math display">\[z_{hi} = (\beta_{0z} +
I_{zi}) + e_{zhi}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
In this final step, we will investigate the role of within-individual
plasticity in generating correlations among repeatedly expressed traits.
Returning to our example of egg size and egg number, we can imagine that
individuals breed repeatedly across a set of years, sometimes
encountering “good” and sometimes encountering “bad” years. We might
expect females to plastically adjust both their eggs size and their
clutch size to food availability, where we expect females to
down-regulate both traits when encountering reduced food availability.
We can model this situation by including food availability (<span
class="math inline">\(x_{hi}\)</span>) as a fixed-effect covariate
affecting both egg size (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta_{1y}x_{hi}\)</span>) and egg number (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta_{1z}x_{hi}\)</span>):
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[y_{hi} = (\beta_{0y} + I_{yi}) +
\beta_{1y}x_{hi} + e_{yhi}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[z_{hi}
= (\beta_{0z} + I_{zi}) + \beta_{1z}x_{hi} + e_{zhi}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
To keep matters simple, we will assume in this example that the two
traits are neither correlated within nor correlated among individuals
due to other mechanisms than variation in food availability. At the same
time, we are assuming that both traits harbour both among- and
within-individual variation.
</p>

<b>Exercise:</b> We will generate a dataset for 100 individuals each
sampled 10 times . Set the within- and among-individual variances for
the two traits. We suggest that you create a dataset where the
associated repeatabilities are 0.5. You will also have to set the
within- and among-individual correlations. For the purpose of this
example, we suggest that you set their values to zero. We will assume
that the environment is changing stochastically between the 10 time
steps, and that the average phenotype in the population has a value of
zero.

<p>
You have set the following bivariate phenotypic equation:
</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[y_{hi} = (\beta_{0y} + I_{yi}) +
\beta_{1y}x_{hi} +e_{yhi}\]</span><span class="math display">\[z_{hi} =
(\beta_{0z} + I_{zi}) + \beta_{1z}x_{hi} + e_{zhi}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
As we have seen in previous steps, we can visualize the patterns at the
overall phenotypic level, within individuals, and among individuals.
Second, we calculated each individual’s mean value for each of the two
traits, and plotted these two values in a scatter plot. This plot of
individual-mean values represents a visual of the among-individual
correlation. Third, we calculated how each observation deviates from an
individual’s mean value for each of the two traits, and plot these two
values in a scatter plot. This plot of within-individual deviations from
individual-means represents a visual of the within-individual
correlation. If you chose a within- and among-individual correlation
equal to zero and also set non-zero slopes for x for both traits, you
will see that the data show a within-individual correlation. The
correlation emerges at this level because we set the simulation to
produce a situation where all individuals were sampled equally often and
at the same time (i.e., there was no variation in the timing of
sampling). This meant that the environment (food availability) varied
within but not among individuals, and therefore caused correlations
between egg size and number within but not among individuals either. We
will now fit a bivariate mixed-effects model to these data, where we
will fit the following phenotypic equation with the following random
effects structures:

<span class="math display">\[y_{hi} = (\beta_{0y} + I_{yi}) +
e_{yhi}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[z_{hi} = (\beta_{0z} +
I_{zi}) + e_{zhi}\]</span>

The residual errors (<span class="math inline">\(e_{hi}\)</span>) are
likewise assumed to be drawn from a multivariate normal distribution,
with means of zero, within-individual variances (<span
class="math inline">\(V_{e_y}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(V_{e_z}\)</span>), and within-individual
covariances (<span class="math inline">\(Cov_{e_{y},e_{z}}\)</span>):

<p>
<span class="math display">\[y_{hi} = (\beta_{0y} + I_{yi}) +

(\beta_{0z} + I_{zi}) + \beta_{1z}x_{hi} + e_{zhi}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
This new model should properly recover the effect of x on y and z. You
will notice that the residual within-individual covariance (<span
class="math inline">\(Cov_{e_y,e_z}\)</span>) should now better resemble
the estimate that you should have expected based on the
within-individual correlation that you entered previously. This is
because the within-individual covariance is now explained by the fixed
effect covariate, and therefore food availability no longer contributes
to the residual within-individual variances.
</p>
<p>
<b>Conclusion:</b> integration of plasticity, where the same
environmental factor affects multiple phenotypic traits, leads to
patterns of trait correlations in phenotypic data. Provided that such
environmental factors varied solely within individuals, environmental
variation would cause residual within-individual correlations if not
accounted for. Though not further articulated here, we can imagine that
such types of environmental effects could also cause among-individual
correlations in situations where the sampling design was such that it
resulted in among-individual variation in the timing of sampling. In
such situations, among- and within-individual correlations would occur
in the presence of integration of plasticity, provided that its effects
were not modelled in the fixed-effects structure of the statistical
model. We will explore this issue and others in another module (Sampling
and Bivariate Models).
