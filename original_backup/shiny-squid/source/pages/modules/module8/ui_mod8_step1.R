  # Introduction
  p(HTML(paste0("<b>Introduction:</b> Multidimensional phenotypic plasticity is a widespread feature of most living organisms. 
                In many cases it appears to be adaptive. For example, copulating male dung flies stay in copula for 
                a length of time that depends on the size of the female and the abundance of females in the local 
                population, and this fits reasonably well with what we would predict given the fitness gained 
                from staying in copula longer or leaving to search for a new female. For this to have evolved via 
                selection, at some point there must have been among-individual variation reflecting genetic variation 
                for multidimensionality. In other words, one individual probably had a different plane than another. 
                In the module labelled <i>",Module_titles$mod5,"</i>, you visualized individuals who had 
                reaction norm planes that differed by intercept. Might they differ in slope as well? And, in which 
                dimensions? If you have done the module on random regression (we do highly recommend doing the 
                tutorial on random regression first), you will have some idea of what individual variation in slope means, 
                but extending it to 2 or more dimensions adds some complexity. Here we take you through the process of 
                adding individual variation to different bits of the equation describing a reaction norm plane."))),
