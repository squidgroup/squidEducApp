  #### Introduction ####
  p(HTML("Introduction: Before you start analyzing your data, one thing you want to consider is the biology of 
         what you're looking at and the how the phenomenon you're interested in is expressed by organisms. 
         Most of the statistical methods we're familiar with make assumptions about how data are distributed 
         (or, really, how errors are distributed), specifically they assume that our data are normally distributed 
         (i.e., having a Gaussian error structure). However, is this always an appropriate assumption?")),

  p("While the assumption of normality (in residuals) may work in many instances, 
    it is also easy to think of biological traits that clearly don't fit this framework. 
    For example, the sex-ratio of your offspring will not be something that can be measured 
    in such a way that the data would be normally distributed and thus can't be analyzed with typical models. 
    This is most apparent in species with temperature-dependent sex determination where the temperature 
    an egg is incubated at determines whether it is female or male :"),

    how temperature affects sex ratio would be inappropriate."),
  
  p("A simpler case than this one is one where sex is determined via particular 
    combinations of allosomes  (i.e. sex chromosomes). In such cases the sex of offspring

    an egg is either female or male, a seed either germinates or it doesn't. 
    These outcomes are, generally, independent of each other and this is actually the key assumption for 
    analyzing proportional data. Importantly, data that is expressed or summarized as a proportion but 
    is not generated from a Bernoulli cannot be analyzed in the same manner. 
    For example, we might often express time spent performing a particular action as a proportion 
    but how we divide the time increments over which we record are typically not independent of each other. 
    For example, if an individual is currently foraging, it is likely still foraging 
    a second later but way less likely a week later. This distinction can be very important 
    in analyses and when data not generated by a Bernoulli processes are analyzed as a proportion, 
    any resulting p-values and confidence estimates will be inappropriate."),

    over some sampling period (breeding season, life-time, etc.) is then the average of what is
