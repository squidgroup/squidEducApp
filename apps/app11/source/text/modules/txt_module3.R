                        (the variance among individuals, $V_",NOT$devI,"$, the variance caused by measurement error, $V_",NOT$mError,"$, 
                        and variance caused by the environment, $V_",NOT$envEffect,"$). In the final step of that module, 
                        we illustrated how measurement of the environment could help explain some of the variance. 
                        Often, when we study phenotypes in natural populations, many aspects of the environment 
                        that could affect phenotypes will be unknown and so not measured. In Step 3, 
                        this unmeasured environmental variance ended up as &ldquo;residual&rdquo; variance, 
                        and it had no effect on the estimate of among-individual variance because 
                        the environment was randomly determined from one sampling period to another 
                        and all individuals were sampled at the same time and experienced the same environment. 
                        In the present module, we explore what happens when we relax this obviously simplified assumption. 
                        For example, suppose the environment changes steadily over the sampling period.

                         of the variance components: We defined $V_",NOT$devI,"$ as the variance among individuals that permanently 
                         affected their phenotype throughout the sampling period. Biologically, 
                         this can be ascribed to genetic differences or environments acting during development 
                         (e.g., before measurements started). When environments are unshared during sampling, 
                         the environment is affecting the phenotype each time it is expressed. However, because 
                         the environment is autocorrelated across sampling episodes and differs among individuals, 
                         apparent individual differences arise because individuals are in different environments 
                         not because they entered the time period of phenotypic expression differing in their 
                         phenotype (note: You may be thinking that since individuals in the real world partially 
                         choose their environment then their phenotype is not solely due to the environment. 
                         That is true but does not change the fact that for the focal trait it is sensitive 
                         to the environment the individual is in each time it is expressed. We will get to

                    solution to potential biases created by non-stochastic environments. 
                    But, because unshared environments can create biases even with identical 
                    sampling (and often identical sampling will be nearly impossible to achieve), 
                    the only other solution is to measure the environment and account for

                         that the impact of the environmental variance that exists among individuals 
                         is the same as that of the variance in environment within-individuals.

                         and those resources may fluctuate some from day to day as well. Thus in your population, 
                         there is both among-individual variance in environment 
                         (e.g., differences between territories) and within-individual variance in environment

                         the same effect on phenotype. It is possible that this is not the case. 
                         If so, the method we have demonstrated here will not give accurate estimates of $V_",NOT$devI,"$.
