# SQuID exercises and educational material
This repo contains code for shiny apps included in the SQuID educational material. Each folder under /apps represents a single shiny app to be integrated in a separate app or website where students in behavior and evolutionary ecology can go to learn about applications of mixed-effects models and variance partitioning.
