# SQuID exercises and educational material
This repo contains code for shiny apps included in the SQuID educational material. Each folder under /apps represents a single shiny app to be integrated in a separate app or website where students in behavior and evolutionary ecology can go to learn about applications of mixed-effects models and variance partitioning.

# List of apps
The following stand-alone shiny apps are embedded in the tutorial.

## Module 1
[App 1](https://squidile.shinyapps.io/app1/) Consequences of measurement error on traits

[App 2](https://squidile.shinyapps.io/app2/) Effects of repeated measurements of an invididual on the measurement error
